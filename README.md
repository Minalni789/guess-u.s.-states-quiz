# guess-u.s.-states-quiz
This is a Python quiz program created using the turtle graphics module and pandas library.
The program prompts the user to guess the names of the states and then uses turtle graphics to display the correctly guessed states on a map of the United States. If the user types "Exit", the program will create a new CSV file containing the names of the states the user did not guess. The game continues until the user guesses all 50 states.
